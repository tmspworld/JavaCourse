*********** [Step 03] ***********

This will Initialized the Folder to Github Working 
it create a .git hidden folder to work with Github 

*********** [Step 04] ***********
>git status

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

But If You Want to Initialized Git At Main branch not on master then do

*********** [Step 05] ***********
H:\Learning 2024\JAVA>git init -b main
Initialized empty Git repository in H:/Learning 2024/JAVA/.git/

Here is the main  is the branch name  We can make n numbers of branch like this and upload the data on it

H:\Learning 2024\JAVA>git status       
On branch main

No commits yet

*********** [Step 06] ***********
Now Add Files on Github

When we Want to Git to track our files so we make that files in staging area
When You See Capital 'U' Before File Name that means it is at untracked mode

to make it tracked 
add it staging area

So Here is steps 


*********** [Step 07] ***********
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Start Git to Github.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

>git add [filename] enter
When you press enter it will become in staging area means it will track by Git
There is a capital 'A' Sign in before file

H:\Learning 2024\JAVA>git add Start_Git_to_Github.txt

H:\Learning 2024\JAVA>git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   Start_Git_to_Github.txt

Git log command use to see the Git Repo status

*********** [Step 08] ***********
H:\Learning 2024\JAVA>git log
fatal: your current branch 'main' does not have any commits yet

*********** [Step 09] ***********
